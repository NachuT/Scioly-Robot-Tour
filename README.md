- Connection to 9V power sorce
- Connection to 2 motors, ultrasonic, and MPU6050 sensor
- Full Power Distribution on PCB along with button
## Challenges
I ended up facing a lot of challenges when creating this project from struggling with the thick PCB traces as well as using the wrong IC and essentially having to redo all of the routing 😭.  
## How to integrate
![IMG_5633](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e2f6c2d-a912-4dfd-9863-639637aca42e)
Steps:
1. Take the Case that is required by the competition and remove stock parts as shown in the image
2. Attach all motors just the same way the old motors were attached but leave a little more room for the wheels as these motors are a few mm shorter in total axle length but according to rules this should be fine
3. Attach New PCB same way as the old PCB
4. Program using anything that supports the RPI pico
## BOM
Please view BOM on the file in the root of this repository, the total price is 193$ for all of the parts.
